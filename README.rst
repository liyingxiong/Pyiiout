Welcome to Pyiiout!

Pyiiout is a demonstrative project of using Python and index notation for efficient and consistent implementation of numerical algorithms. Here we use the pull-out problem as an example. A mathmatical description of the pull-out problem using index notation is given in PDF file. The mathmatical formulations in index notation can be easily and consistently transformed to Python code using the NumPy einsum method. See the PDF file for more details.
